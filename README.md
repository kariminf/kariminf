- 📖 Assistant professor at <a href="https://www.esi.dz/">Ecole nationale supérieure d'informatique (ESI, ex. INI), Algiers, Algeria</a>
- 💻 I develop useless programs (unless someone can use them somehow)
- 🍔🌮🍙🍝🍰 I like food and cooking. Cooking is like programming; recipes are like automata
- 🎯 For me, programming is not a language you use; it is an art and a logic. Good programmers are those who master the abstrat form of algorithms, not a specific language or worse: a toolkit
- 👥 Not social, definatly insensitive and sarcasm is my gem. Talking to me is like communicating with an alien 👽 or even a robot 🤖
- 🐱 Lazy like a cat
- 👿 Evil
